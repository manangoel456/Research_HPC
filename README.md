Our results, of
the time processing, points to the fact that the GPU architecture
has accelerated 41X in training deep models. It took 18 minutes
and 12 seconds as compared to CPU architecture which took
12 hours and 20 minutes. Parallelism is the operation ability
of GPU which saves time for training the model and it allows
rapid iteration for the researchers and practitioners.
